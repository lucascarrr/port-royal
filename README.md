# port-royal
A tool for reasoning in FCA, in particular doing defeasible reasoning in FCA. 

## Defeasible Reasoning (Rational Inference) in FCA
If you are interested in the theory behind defeasible reasoning in FCA, you can find our two papers on the arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16938) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04184)

## Using port-royal 

###
Right now, I have only added functionality to parse contexts written as JSON files, you can see examples of what these should look like under `/contexts/`. 

## To Do: 
1. ObjectRank algorithm
2. Defeasible Satisfaction
3. Move beyond horn clauses (although, I'm not even sure if this is a good idea)
